Implementing algorithms in https://cp-algorithms.com/
Most of the times I won't go into hyper-optimized versions of the algorithms, as they are usually not needed. I will try to implement them in a way that is easy to understand and use.

The algorithms I have implemented are:
- [Binary Exponentiation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html)
- [Euclidean Algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html)
- [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/extended-euclid-algorithm.html)
- [Linear Diophantine Equation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/linear-diophantine-equation.html)
- [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/sieve-of-eratosthenes.html)
